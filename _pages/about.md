Hi, there üëã! My name is Ahsan (pronouns: he / him / his). I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php) at [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/) with an emphasis on Cybersecurity and Data Science. I have been working at [Cybersecurity Education, Research & Outreach Center (CEROC)](https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/) as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ambareen Siraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambareensiraj/).

At CEROC, I mainly contribute to the experiential research of both static and dynamic malware analysis for ransomware to propose multi-layered
endpoint protection by incorporating Data Science, Machine Learning, and Reverse Engineering techniques. Additionally, I collaborate with the external security researchers in industry, U.S. national labs, and other universities to initiate as well as review the scope of research, perform experimentations, observe its progress, and analyze the empirical findings.

I instruct CSC 1300: Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C++ at [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/). I am responsible to develop the class materials, the exam/quiz questions, and the programming assignments/challenges. I also manage the online quizzes and grading of the course.

Aside from work, I enjoy learning industry standards of (Secure) Software Development as well as state-of-the-art (academia and industry) practices of Data Science and Machine Learning, participating competitive in the programming challenges primarily under the category of Algorithms and Data Structure using C / C++, and involving in outreach / (voluntary) leadership activities.
