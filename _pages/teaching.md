**[Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C/C++](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021)**

I taught this course in the Fall 2021 semester at the [Department of Computer Sciecne](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php), [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/). The developed content of the course is as follows:

* [Intro to C++](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/1_intro_to_c%2B%2B)
* [Variables and Assignments](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/2_variables_and_assignments)
* [Branches and Flow Control](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/3_branches_and_flow_control)
* [Loops](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/4_loops)
* [Functions and Pointers](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/5_functions_and_pointers)
* [Arrays and Pointers](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/6_arrays_and_pointers)
* [Strings and Pointers](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/7_strings_and_pointers)
* [Vectors](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/8_vectors)
* [File I/O](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/9_file_io)
* [Structures](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/tntech_csc_1300_fall_2021/tree/main/10_structures)

Each chapter contains the slide deck used to teach the class, a set of coding examples to better understand the topics, and a list of helpful resources.
